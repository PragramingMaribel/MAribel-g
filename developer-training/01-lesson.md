# Lesson One, Github and Atom

## 1.1 - Go to https://github.com and create an account.

*You must enter the aforementioned link, place your data, register and then verify your email to have your account 100% active

## 1.2 - Go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and download git.

*Enter the download link, proceed to download it and install the GIT on your computer.

## 1.3 - Go to https://atom.io/ and download atom (it is a editor).

*For atom we will perform the same discharge procedure as the GIT

## 1.4 - clone https://github.com/coranos/coranos.github.io to your local computer.

*To clone a github we will open our GIT after having installed it and it will give us 3 options CREATE NEW REPOSITORY, CLONE EXISTING REPOSITORY AND OPEN EXISTING REPOSITORY, as it is the first time that we will go to where it says clone existing repository and we will place the address of the github that we want to clone and the address where the cloning process will be saved

*If you are unsure of how to do this, here are the commands to use in *git bash*:
```
cd;
pwd;
mkdir git;
cd git;
git clone https://github.com/coranos/banano-developer-training.git;
cd banano-developer-training;
```

## 1.5 - Using the Github Web Page, add your Discord ID to the Student  list.

https://github.com/coranos/banano-developer-training/blob/master/developer-training/students.md

Use the "lreferenct style link" format the way the other students are doing it, where the link to your page is at the bottom of the student list, and is referenced by name at the table in the top. Do not use "inline link" style, as it will cause future lessons to get too complicated.
